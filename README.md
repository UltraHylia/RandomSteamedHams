This project originally started as a basic joke to output the script of "Steamed Hams", with Chalmers lines in a randomised order. I later had the idea to extend this functionality to other characters, and coded it to do so; the code allows for the selection of which characters should be randomised, however I never created the user interface to be able to do so, so it has to be toggled directly via the code.

This project is generally not being worked on any more. My friend GourmetSubZee has produced a better version of this (with video!) here: https://github.com/GourmetSubZee/SteamedHamsScrambler
